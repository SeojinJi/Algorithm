It creates a BST with an input of integer list, and returns the root node.

To prevent this, the input may be given to you in a way that the condition of BST child is violated. Originally, current node's left value has to be smaller than current value, while the right value has to be bigger than current value. Here, we do not apply this rule to grand children. For example, BST below may be given to you. 9 is smaller than 10 but it is located at the right subtree of node with value 9.
