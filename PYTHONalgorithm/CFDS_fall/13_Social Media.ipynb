    "## Practice 2. Social Media\n",
    "\n",
    "In some social media platforms, there are members numbered from 1 to n, and friend relationships can be represented as tuples.\n",
    "For example, (1, 2) indicates that member 1 and member 2 are friends.\n",
    "Therefore, friend relationships can be represented as a graph. \n",
    "In this context, let's define a cluster as all members connected through friend relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement a function called \"cluster\" that returns the number of members in the cluster to which member 1 belongs."
